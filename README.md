### What I learned

In this project I learn how to use background image as svg and how to properly layout them for optimal cross-platform view.

```css
.background_image--top {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 45%;
  right: 50%;
}

.background_image--bottom {
  position: fixed;
  top: 50%;
  left: 45%;
}
```
